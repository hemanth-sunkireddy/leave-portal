        to allow students to raise requests for their leave, 
        trace the request status, and modify them. On the Mentor Dashboard, 
        the software also allows the Mentor/ Mentor Coordinator to view requests, and approve/decline requests. 
        Whereas on the Hostel Dashboard, 
        the Warden/ Deputy Warden and Hostel Supervisors will be able to view and grant leave passes to the students.
        This Automated System will provide ease to all the actors â€“ students, mentors, hostel authorities, 
        and security services in regard to leaving/outpassing sanctions and will ultimately eliminate the paperwork."
